# Travel-and-Tourism
We made this website as our mid term project of Advanced Programming in Web Technology course. This is a travel and tourism website build on Laravel framework containing four roles : Admin, Employee, Service Provider and User. The website will have different features like tour packages, information of different travel places, transport services and hotel services. User can directly register from registration form and service providers can apply for account through the registration form which will be approved or declined by the Admin. Admin account and Employee account can be made only by Admin.Here we implemented a package for download the pdf of several reports. All of the forms are validated. The contributors of this Project are: Md. Nabobi Hasan, Mufrad Mustavi, Md Tanvir Siam and me Md. Abu Jubaer. If you want the sql file of the project for testing you can contact me.
